# AML/CTF Policy


**Purpose:**
Define the bank's AML/CTF obligations, risk appetite, and control expectations under EU AMLR to detect, prevent, and report financial crime.

## Scope
- All customer segments, products, channels, and jurisdictions.
- Customer due diligence, enhanced due diligence, sanctions screening, and transaction monitoring.
- All employees, contractors, and outsourced service providers.

## Policy Statement
- The bank maintains a risk-based AML/CTF framework aligned to EU AMLR and applicable national requirements.
- Customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring are mandatory for all relationships.
- Enhanced due diligence is required for higher-risk customers, including PEPs and complex ownership structures.
- Sanctions screening is required for onboarding, ongoing monitoring, and transactions.
- Transaction monitoring scenarios are calibrated to cover current typologies and regulatory expectations.
- Suspicious activity is investigated and reported to the FIU without delay.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Compliance and MLRO: Own the AML/CTF framework and reporting.
- Business Units: Execute controls and escalation procedures.
- Operations: Maintain records, evidence, and audit trails.
- Internal Audit: Independently tests AML/CTF effectiveness.

## Compliance and Exceptions
