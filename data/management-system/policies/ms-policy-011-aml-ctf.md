- Customer due diligence, enhanced due diligence, sanctions screening, and transaction monitoring.
- All employees, contractors, and outsourced service providers.

## Policy Statement
- The bank maintains a risk-based AML/CTF framework aligned to EU AMLR and applicable national requirements.
- Customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring are mandatory for all relationships.
- Enhanced due diligence is required for higher-risk customers, including PEPs and complex ownership structures.
- Sanctions screening is required for onboarding, ongoing monitoring, and transactions.
- Transaction monitoring scenarios are calibrated to cover current typologies and regulatory expectations.
- Suspicious activity is investigated and reported to the FIU without delay.

## Roles and Responsibilities
