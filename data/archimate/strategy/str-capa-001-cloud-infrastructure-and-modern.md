# Modern Infrastructure and Architecture Capability

Strategic capability to build, deploy, and operate applications with modern microservices architectures, infrastructure-as-code practices, and containerization—deployed on secure, sovereign on-premises infrastructure with cloud-native operational benefits.

## Description

This capability enables the bank to adopt modern infrastructure practices including containerization, orchestration, infrastructure-as-code, and DevOps that improve agility, scalability, and reduce operational complexity—while maintaining data sovereignty and operational independence through on-premises deployment.

## Capability Components

### People
- Cloud architects
- DevOps engineers
- Infrastructure engineers
- Kubernetes specialists
- Security engineers (cloud)
- SRE (Site Reliability Engineers)

### Process
- Cloud strategy and planning
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Container orchestration
- Deployment automation
- Continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD)
- Cloud cost optimization
- Multi-cloud management

### Technology
- On-premises infrastructure modernization
- Container platforms (Docker/Kubernetes) on-premises
- Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, Ansible)
- CI/CD pipelines and tools
- On-premises monitoring and logging
- Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
- API gateways
- Edge computing capabilities

### Information
- Cloud architecture diagrams
- Cloud resource inventory
- Cost allocation and tracking
- Performance metrics
- Security and compliance audit results
- Migration roadmaps

## Current State
Legacy on-premises data center infrastructure
- Monolithic application architecture
- Manual deployments
- High operational complexity
- Limited infrastructure automation
- Maturity: 1 - Initial

## Target State

- Modern on-premises infrastructure with cloud-native practices
- Containerized microservices architecture
- Automated CI/CD deployments (infrastructure-as-code)
- 25-30% infrastructure cost reduction through efficiency
- 99.99% availability with on-premises resilience
- Full data sovereignty and operational independencere cost reduction
- 99.99% availability
- Maturity: 4 - Managed

## Strategic Value through automation and efficiency
- Improved scalability and flexibility with modern architecture
- Faster time-to-market through CI/CD automation
- Reduced operational complexity with infrastructure-as-code
- Built-in resilience and redundancy on-premises
- Modern development practices and DevOps
- Data sovereignty and geopolitical independence
- Operational control and transparency
- Reduced third-party dependencyty
- Built-in resilience and redundancy
- Modern development practices
