# DORA Digital Operational Resilience Requirements

EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) mandating financial institutions maintain robust operational resilience and cybersecurity practices.

## Description

DORA is a comprehensive EU regulation establishing harmonized requirements for digital operational resilience across financial institutions. It became applicable to significant financial institutions on January 10, 2025, and requires immediate action to achieve full compliance.

## Key Regulatory Areas

- **ICT Security Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of information and communication technology (ICT) security incidents
- **ICT Incident Reporting**: Tiered incident reporting to competent authorities based on severity
- **ICT Risk Management**: Comprehensive ICT risk management framework and governance
- **Business Continuity**: Testing and maintenance of business continuity and recovery procedures
- **Third-Party Risk Management**: Due diligence and ongoing monitoring of ICT third-party service providers
- **Cybersecurity Testing**: Advanced threat-led penetration testing (TLPT) and digital resilience testing

## Impact on Banking

- Mandatory incident detection and reporting timelines
- Severe penalties for non-compliance (up to 10% of annual revenue)
- Board-level accountability for digital resilience
- Significant technology and process investments required
- Integration with existing compliance frameworks (GDPR, NIS2, etc.)

## Timeline

- January 10, 2025: Framework entered into force for significant institutions
- Phased implementation: 24 months for full technical compliance
- Ongoing testing and certification requirements

## Strategic Considerations

DORA significantly increases operational resilience requirements and cybersecurity investment. It transforms digital resilience from IT concern to board-level strategic priority.
