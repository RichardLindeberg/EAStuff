# Open Banking Capability

Develop a modern API platform and ecosystem partnerships to enable open banking services and create new revenue opportunities.

## Description

PSD2 regulations mandate open banking capabilities. This goal transforms this regulatory requirement into a strategic opportunity by building secure APIs and fostering partnerships with fintech and service providers.

## Objectives

1. **Secure API Platform**: Build production-ready APIs for account information and payment services
2. **Developer Portal**: Establish self-service developer portal for partner integration
3. **Fintech Partnerships**: Establish partnerships with complementary fintech providers
4. **Embedded Finance**: Enable embedded banking services in third-party platforms
5. **Revenue Generation**: Create new B2B revenue streams through API monetization

## Success Metrics

- API availability: >99.95% uptime
- Number of active third-party integrations: >50 by 2027
- API transaction volume: >10% of digital transactions
- Developer community size: >1000 active developers
- New API-based revenue: >5% of digital revenue

## Strategic Alignment

Open banking transforms the bank from a siloed institution into a platform participant, enabling growth through partnerships and ecosystem participation.
