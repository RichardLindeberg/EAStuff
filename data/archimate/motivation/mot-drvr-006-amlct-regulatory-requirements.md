# AML/CT Regulatory Requirements

External regulatory pressures from anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism (CT) financing legislation including EU AML Directives, local regulations, and international standards.

## Description

The AML/CT regulatory landscape continues to evolve with increasingly stringent requirements. Key regulatory drivers include:

- **EU AML Directives (4AMLD, 5AMLD, 6AMLD)**: Enhanced customer due diligence, beneficial ownership registers, and expanded scope
- **FATF Recommendations**: International standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing
- **Nordic National Regulations**: Specific requirements from Swedish Finansinspektionen, Norwegian Finanstilsynet, and Danish Finanstilsynet
- **PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication**: Enhanced transaction security requirements
- **Travel Rule**: Requirements for information sharing on cryptocurrency transfers
- **Sanctions Screening**: Compliance with EU and international sanctions lists

## Impact

AML/CT regulations have profound impacts on:

- **Customer Onboarding**: Extended KYC processes and documentation requirements
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Sophisticated systems for detecting suspicious activities
- **Reporting Obligations**: Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to Financial Intelligence Units
- **Record Keeping**: 5-10 year retention requirements for customer data and transactions
- **IT Systems**: Significant investment in compliance technology
- **Training**: Mandatory staff training and awareness programs
- **Penalties**: Severe fines and reputational damage for non-compliance

## Recent Developments

- **Increased Scrutiny**: Regulators conducting more frequent and detailed examinations
- **Cross-Border Coordination**: Enhanced cooperation between national authorities
- **Technology Expectations**: Growing expectation for AI/ML in transaction monitoring
- **Beneficial Ownership Transparency**: Public registers and enhanced verification
- **Crypto Asset Regulations**: Extension of AML/CT requirements to digital assets
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Move towards continuous monitoring versus periodic reviews

## Strategic Considerations

- Balance compliance costs with business growth objectives
- Invest in technology to automate compliance processes
- Build strong compliance culture throughout organization
- Collaborate with industry peers on best practices
- Maintain strong relationships with regulatory authorities
- Consider reputational risk in addition to regulatory penalties
- Prepare for future regulatory expansions (crypto, ESG-related financial crimes)

## Stakeholder Expectations

- **Regulators**: Zero tolerance for compliance failures
- **Customers**: Fast onboarding while maintaining security
- **Board**: Effective risk management and minimal regulatory exposure
- **Society**: Active role in preventing financial crimes
