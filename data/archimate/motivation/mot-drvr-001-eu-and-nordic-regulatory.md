# EU and Nordic Regulatory Requirements

External regulatory pressures including GDPR, MiFID II, PSD2, Basel III, and local banking regulations in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.

## Description

The Nordic and EU regulatory environment is one of the most stringent globally. Key regulatory drivers include:

- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy requirements
- **MiFID II**: Investment service transparency and investor protection
- **PSD2**: Open banking and payment service requirements
- **Basel III**: Capital adequacy and risk management requirements
- **Local Regulations**: Specific requirements from national financial authorities

## Impact

These regulations shape strategic priorities, require significant IT investment, and impose penalties for non-compliance. Staying ahead of regulatory changes is essential for competitive advantage.

## Trends

- Increasing focus on ESG and sustainability reporting
- Evolving cybersecurity requirements
- Enhanced customer data rights
- Strengthened anti-money laundering (AML) requirements
- Real-time payment obligations

## Strategic Considerations

Rather than viewing regulations as constraints, this bank views them as differentiators. Exceeding regulatory requirements builds customer trust and competitive advantage in Nordic markets.
