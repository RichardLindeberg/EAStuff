# Cost Pressures and Margin Compression

Persistent margin compression due to low interest rates, regulatory costs, and competition from fintech and international players.

## Description

Nordic banking faces significant cost pressures:

- Low interest rate environment reducing net interest margins
- High regulatory compliance costs
- Rising customer acquisition costs
- Legacy IT infrastructure maintenance burden
- Talent acquisition and retention costs

## Impact

Profitability is under pressure, requiring operational efficiency improvements and revenue diversification. Banks that fail to optimize costs face margin compression and reduced investment capacity.

## Response Strategy

The bank is responding through systematic cost reduction, technology modernization, and process automation while maintaining investment in customer experience and digital capabilities.

## Financial Outlook

Achieving operational efficiency targets of 20-25% cost reduction will restore competitive margins and fund strategic investments in digital capabilities.
