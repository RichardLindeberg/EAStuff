# PlantUML Diagram Guidance

The repository no longer generates PlantUML files automatically. Diagram generation is handled by the F# server UI, and static PlantUML outputs are not produced.

## If You Need PlantUML

- Create PlantUML diagrams manually in your documentation
- Use the PlantUML VS Code extension for preview and export
- Store any custom diagrams alongside the docs that reference them

## Preferred Workflow

- Use the F# server for interactive browsing and validation
- Use external modeling tools for publication-grade diagrams if needed
