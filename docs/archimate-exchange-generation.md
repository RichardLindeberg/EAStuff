# ArchiMate Exchange Generation Status

The ArchiMate exchange generator scripts have been removed. Exporting `.archimate` files is not currently supported in this repository.

## Current Options

- Use the F# server for interactive browsing and validation
- Use external modeling tools to create and export exchange files

If exchange generation is needed again, it should be reintroduced as a dedicated tool with clear versioning and schema alignment.
