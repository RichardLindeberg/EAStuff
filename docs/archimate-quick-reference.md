# Quick Reference: ArchiMate Exchange

Exchange file generation is not currently available in this repository. The previous generator scripts have been removed.

## What You Can Do Now

- Run the F# server to browse and validate the model
- Use external tools to create and export ArchiMate exchange files if needed

If exchange generation is reintroduced, this guide should be updated with the new command and schema version.
